# Front-End

This is the home of the NEURONE components that make part of the front-end. Made to be used inside Angular projects, and can be downloaded via NPM in the package neurone-angular-components. The source code of the Angular library is currently inside Neurone-web-components, which is also an Angular project where these components can be tested as a demo.

As an alternative, the components are also compiled as web components, located inside the "demo" folder, these haven't been thoroughly tested.
